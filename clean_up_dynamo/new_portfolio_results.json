    "description": "My portfolio is meant to showcase the movement of artistic styles in Europe during the Renaissance Period. The Renaissance entailed a \"rebirth\" of knowledge and appreciation for classic Greek and Rome that had wide-spread impacts on European society, especially on art and architecture. Art styles during this time became more naturalistic, reflecting both  the development of better artistic techniques and a renewed emphasis on humanism and the importance of temporal subjects. Though the Renaissance began in Italy, it spread throughout Europe, and took on a slightly different character in what came to be known as the \"Northern Renaissance.\" My portfolio includes examples from both northern and southern Europe. The Renaissance revitalized Europe and made possible much of the modern world we know today. I hope my portfolio helps demonstrate some of the broad artistic changes that the Renaissance fostered among European artists. ",

As such, it represents much of the pre-Renaissance style, as can be noted with the representations of the Madonna and Child, which have a very two-dimensional and not particularly naturalistic style. The icon-like style of the portrait, also typical of Late Middle Ages Western European art, can be seen through the heavy use of gold, the medium of wood, and the arch-like shape of the piece.",

Although the 19th century collection is renowned, the 20th century collection is equally significant but lesser known. This portfolio are highlights from the exhibition of the same name on view at the Snite Museum of Art from August 11, 2020 \u2013 February 27, 2021 in the O\u2019Shaughnessy Galleries.\n\nAmong this survey are iconic works by Alfred Stieglitz and Lewis Wickes Hine at the dawn of the century, as well as photographs by Sally Mann and John Baldessari in is final decades. In the academic setting, the photographs have been chosen to exemplify major developments in visual culture, historical events, and the stylistic and technical evolution of photography. This dynamic century\u2013marked by two world wars, aesthetic and news pictures, and humans on the Moon\u2013is preserved in the collective memory in photographic images.",

In the mid-1920s, she wanted to expand beyond her rarified clientele and took her camera to the country in upstate New York. Later she befriended the Pulitzer-Prize winning writer Julia Mood Peterkin. When visiting Peterkin at her plantation, Lang Syne, in South Carolina, Ulmann had the chance to photograph the farm workers, who lived much as their enslaved forebears. Yet Ulmann\u2019s images also represent sociability, generosity, and repose. This is one of several of Ulmann\u2019s Lang Syne images that present her subject\u2019s occupation as integral to her personality. A woman of dignity and accomplishment, she shares community responsibilities. Ulmann published her photographs, along with a selection of Peterkin\u2019s writing about African American life, in Roll, Jordan, Roll, named for the eighteenth-century Anglican hymn embraced by the African American community.",

She became an assistant to Man Ray, who helped refine her technical expertise and introduced her to many artists. Among them was Eug\u00e8ne Atget, who photographed Paris as it changed over his lifetime. When Abbott returned to New York after eight years in France, she found the city much changed. She photographed the transformation of New York, as Atget had recorded the evolution of Paris. For this image Abbott stood with her back to the Hudson River to photograph a row of old buildings warming in the afternoon sun. What seems at first to be a static architectural view teems with life on close inspection. Delivery vehicles represent the transformation of business in Tribeca as an officer directs traffic. Today, this street has become the West Side Highway, with six busy lanes of speeding traffic.",

In 1880 he took up photography and the fashionable gum-bichromate technique. It enabled him to combine photographic imagery with hand drawing to give images a sketchy, expressive quality. \u201cIf a man slavishly copies nature,\u201d Demachy wrote, \u201cno matter if it is with hand and pencil or through a photographic lens, he may be a supreme artist all the while, but that particular work of his cannot be called a work of art.\u201d For Plains of Holland Demachy used a negative he made in the Netherlands. Working from his image, he drew on a sheet of writing paper with a mixture of watery ink, gum arabic, and light-sensitive potassium dichromate. When the sheet was exposed in contact with his negative, the gum hardened in proportion to the amount of light received. When the sheet was washed, an image of tinted gum was left where the artist had drawn.",

    "annotation": "From his teen years Edward Steichen worked simultaneously as a painter and a photographer. In the late 1890s, he made watercolors and oil paintings in a luminous style inspired by Impressionism and the work of James McNeill Whistler. He experimented with visual effects of different colors in several versions of the moon rising through a screen of trees. This photograph is one of them, made on Long Island in summer 1904. To explore color effects in his photographs, Steichen printed this image in platinum, then superimposed layers of colored gum from the same negative on the same sheet. He achieved a similar effect in this enlarged photogravure, made sixty years later, by directing the intaglio printer to ink and wipe the plate with black, blue, and green inks. One of Steichen\u2019s few surviving Moonrise paintings of the 1910s is now in the Snite Museum collection and on view on the second floor.",

He dedicated himself more to photography than his studies, and decided after one term to leave the university and become a photojournalist. He worked for Newsweek and LIFE magazine often quarreling with editors. Nevertheless, Smith became the leading American photojournalist of his generation. He worked in the Pacific Theater during World War II, landing on Saipan with the United States Marines. Before their arrival, Japanese civilians and soldiers fled the cities, and the Marines had to hunt for them in the mountains and forests. During one methodical search, the Marines found an infant hidden in a hole by his fleeing mother. Smith captured the moment of the baby\u2019s discovery, just before he was rushed to a military hospital. A mirror image of this photograph appeared in LIFE in summer 1944, in an article on the Saipan operation.",

A Liberal advocate for social change, he created remarkable documentary series on life in the Bowery and in Harlem. Later, he befriended Adolph Gottlieb, Mark Rothko, and Barnett Newman, and shared the discussions that provided the conceptual foundations of Abstract Expressionism. Siskind also explored abstraction in his photographs. This image, made during summer vacation in New England, demonstrates how he used the viewfinder to mark balanced compositions. Siskind often photographed straight on, holding his camera perpendicular to walls and floors. He concentrated an arresting graphic design in these images without surrounding context and or spatial perspective.",

He marked a spot on the front porch where he could set up and relocate his tripod to photograph changing weather and light effects over the bay. This image, taken at sunrise on November 1, 1998, records a luminous cloud bank moving northward as the morning sunlight warms the atmosphere. Misrach took 700 photographs from his porch, 85 of which appeared in his photobook Golden Gate.",

Exposed in the enlarger, the clear portions of the sheet printed black, and the colored areas as a range of white and gray. Then he made gelatin silver prints several times larger than the handmade negatives. Sommer named this image for the Swiss Renaissance physician, botanist and alchemist, Paracelsus who is credited with founding the discipline of toxicology.

This photograph, from their time of collaboration, reflects Mather\u2019s interest in Japanese design, as well as the soft tonality of Pictorialism. Its bold cropping requires the viewer to imagine the complete figure. By representing the dancer turned from the viewer, Mather shifts our attention from her personality to the sculptural quality of her form.

They witnessed early flights by aviation pioneers like Louis Bl\u00e9riot, and attended the Grand Prix race of the Automobile Club de France. In 1913, nineteen-year-old Lartigue captured this image of Ren\u00e9 Croquet at the annual race held that year at Amiens. Standing on the roadside, he tried to follow the speeding car with his camera. He was not quite fast enough, and the simultaneous movements of car and shutter resulted in an image in which diagonals seem to fan away from the central axis. Lartigue was insightful enough not to destroy his negative, but to print it.",

He was a professor at VkhUTEMAS (the Higher State Artistic and Technical Studios), an academy conceived to produce well-designed, utilitarian objects for everyday living. Rodchenko embraced photography as a universally accessible visual medium. VkhUTEMAS took over Yushkov House from the Moscow Art Academy, a venerable beaux-arts-style city palace where art had been taught for over a century. When Rodchenko photographed the academy, however, he concentrated on this adjacent dormitory, built on the academy ground after the Revolution. In this Modernist high-rise block, students, faculty and administrators occupied identical apartments. The artist used the building\u2019s geometry as an arresting graphic design element.",

When he became involved with the Civil Rights Movement as a college student, he was appointed staff photographer for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. In 1967 the photographer was permitted to take his camera into the prisons of Texas, where he made many friends among the inmates over the fourteen-month project. This image is one from a sequence depicting a team preparing the fields for planting on a prison farm in East Texas. White uniforms protect them from the sun as they hoe in unison.

She covered the European Theater during World War II and became the first woman photographer accredited to the United States Air Force.

He studied literature in college and spent time in Paris, before returning to a job on Wall Street. Living in Greenwich Village during the 1930s, Evans associated with writers and artists like James Agee, Hart Crane and Ben Shahn. He learned the finer points of photography, studied its history, and tried visually to encapsulate American experience. Evans developed his instinctive sense of pictorial composition to correlate with a direct and plainspoken style of writing. In this image an engaging geometrical interplay is simplified by a straight side view of the farmhouse. The Ford pickup parked outside invites us to imagine its owner, and the home\u2019s interior.",

While growing up in Omaha he enjoyed two memorable summers with his Uncle Harry and Aunt Clara on their remote Nebraska farm. Morris studied literature in college, then in 1933 he trekked through Europe with a camera to photograph his adventures. In the 1940s Morris combined his photographs with excerpts of original prose \u201cphototexts,\u201d interdependent works of art for exhibition. Some of these projects were published as books, including The Home Place, of 1948. Taken for the project, this photograph of the humble train station at Panama conveys the isolation of the prairie, and evokes Morris\u2019s childhood memories. He often photographed deserted and time-worn buildings on the Plains, standing mute records of past activity.",

    "annotation": "In 1962, Joel Meyerowitz bought a single-lens reflex camera and taught himself to use the darkroom. Every day he went out onto the streets of Manhattan and shot candid 35-mm Kodachrome slides of his fellow New Yorkers. In the darkroom he methodically studied the limitations of chromogenic printing. Meyerowitz bought an old 8 x 10-inch view camera in 1976. It demanded a slower rhythm, and its expensive film caused the photographer to focus on static images without figures. In Vivian\u2019s Things, Meyerowitz used his large camera to investigate light, space and color. Bright seaside light pours into the bedroom of a rented Cape Cod beach house. The reflections from different angles in glass surfaces around the room provide a complex view of the small space. Meyerowitz arranged a riot of colors and patterns reminiscent of the work of Les Nabis, the young Parisian painters of the 1890s\u2014like Pierre Bonnard and \u00c9douard Vuillard\u2014who combined the bright colors of Impressionism with compositional distortion.",

    "annotation": "Ilse Bing took up photography to aid in her art history thesis. The medium transformed her perception of space and light, and she shifted to the profession of photography. She moved from Frankfurt to Paris in 1930 and became a photojournalist. Her creative work combined geometric studies of light and deep shadow with available light. This image shows not only the artist\u2019s fascination with the physics of reflected light, but also her relationship to her Leica camera, the mechanical tool of her visual creativity. With the use of two mirrors, this image provides both a frontal and profile view of the subject, like a Cubist composition. The large button on the photographer\u2019s cuff disturbs the play between the two. Its geometric form accentuates the play shape, space and tone in this complex image.",

    "annotation": "A child of privilege, Alvin Langdon Coburn was introduced to photography by his attentive, widowed mother. She took him to New York, California and Europe, and arranged introductions to Edward Steichen, Robert Demachy and F. Holland Day for the boy. He became the wunderkind of the Photo-Secession. In 1904 the commission for a series of portraits took Coburn to London. He explored the city with his camera, photographing views influenced by the work of James McNeill Whistler and Paul C\u00e9zanne. Over five years he accumulated images that he transformed into photogravure, etching and printing the plates himself. This plate from Coburn\u2019s London series reflects his shift from the aesthetics of Pictorialism to Modernism. Silhouetted in the sunlight, the softened outlines of a horse-drawn omnibus evoke indistinct memories. The poetic image evokes the hazy atmosphere of a city still shrouded in smoke and fog at the turn of the 20th century.",

    "annotation": "When Hiroshi Sugimoto graduated from Rikkyo University in 1974, he set off with a backpack and camera instead of taking a salaried job. He settled in Los Angeles to study photography, then moved to New York to work as a creative photographer. Sugimoto\u2019s photographs of displays at the American Museum of Natural History, with their taxidermy mounts in fictive natural habitats, confronted themes of creativity, perception, and time. This image from Sugimoto\u2019s Theaters series grapples with similar issues. To photograph the lavish decor of 1920s American movie palaces, he set up his view camera under the projection booth in each deserted auditorium. He set the timer for the length of a feature film, and ran the movie. The individual frames of the film canceled each other to create a searing white light on screen, illuminating the empty interior. In this way, Sugimoto photographed the opulent room, the duration of the film, and the passage of time.",

The scheme was promoted by alderman Sidney Story and the district came to be known as Storyville. Twenty-five-year old Ernest J. Belloc had then been a New Orleans photographer for several years. He was comfortable in Storyville, blocks from where he had grown up, and he photographed in its gaming rooms, opium dens and bordellos. This is one of a series of intimate portraits of women, thought to be Storyville prostitutes. The familiarity of these images has prompted speculation that Bellocq was a brothel habitu\u00e9 and that photographs reveal friendships with the women. This is a recent print from a group of negatives, discovered in 1967, that prompted much creative fantasy about the photographer and his life.",

A decade later, a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship made it possible for him to journey across America with his camera. He found that the postwar industrial boom had produced a new abundance for Americans, with unprecedented comforts and conveniences. Frank photographed consumers who seem obsessed with these products, but unaware of each other. These marchers gathering before the New York St. Patrick\u2019s Day parade presents a similar alienation. Most of the celebrants appear unaware; only one little girl looks at the photographer. They congregate before a banner proclaiming County Derry as their home. The standard carries a portrait of John Mitchel, the Derry native son and Irish nationalist, who brought his views to the United States before the American Civil War. This symbol of identity visually blocks progress along a canyonlike street, and into the future.",

To illuminate supersonic exposures, he engineered lightbulbs filled with argon, and then xenon, that could produce 60 flashes of light per second. In order to demonstrate his stroboscopic lighting systems and envision their broad scientific applications, Edgerton made experimental photographs in the laboratory, often of sports subjects. He recruited Fesler, the Big Ten MVP of 1930 to kick a football in the studio. This split-second exposure reveals the unexpected physics of the event. Fesler\u2019s boot sinks deep into the ball with the force of the kick. A layer of dust dislodged from the ball\u2019s top seam is captured in mid-air.",

In 1919 they moved from Nantes to Paris, where they exhibited and published the pseudonyms Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore. They associated with booksellers Adrienne Monnier and Sylvia Beach, with experimental theater and the Surrealist movement. Aveux non Avenus is a book of Cahun\u2019s reflective writing illustrated with collotype reproductions of original photocollages. The main motif of these images is the artist herself, photographed in androgynous costumes and makeup. Her face and body are cut out and reassembled like paper dolls into decorative patterns, playfully confusing personal and cultural identity. In this headpiece for chapter three, the shape of her shaved head, multiplied and arranged in a cloverleaf, evoke the pips on playing cards of the French suits of clovers and pikes\u2014or clubs and spades.",

Since candid photography was impossible, Brassa\u00ef became acquainted with his subjects, buying drinks as he set up his camera and tripod. He deputized an assistant to hold a pan of magnesium flash powder aloft, which Brassa\u00ef ignited as he uncapped the shutter.

They joined the Surrealist movement and enjoyed its provocative ferment, while Man Ray supported himself as a photographer. He fled to California during World War II, hoping to find work in the film industry. Dismayed that hi European reputation was unknown, the artist reconstructed his lost oeuvre in a catalogue of pivotal works called Objects of My Affection. This photograph from the album documents a construction made from found components. Mounted on a rotating axle is a bicycle mirror with a painted shadow. A cube hangs from a string precisely before the mirror, which reflects its numbered sides. The axle eye also supports doll\u2019s eyes on a spring, and a bell on a cord. If the mirror were set to swing, the reflection would flash, the numbered cube twist, the eyes jiggle, and the bell would sound. Even at rest, the machine suggests these potential effects.",

She studied photography at University of Washington and the Technical University in Dresden, and worked as an assistant to Edward Curtis, before opening her own studio in Seattle. In 1915, Cunningham married the painter Roi Partridge and began a family. They moved to San Francisco, where Partridge taught at Mills College, and Cunningham stayed at home with their young sons. Each afternoon when they were napping, she made still life photographs with basic equipment and an improvised darkroom. She may have been influenced by Karl Blossfeldt\u2019s enlarged plant studies, but her images are more architectural than taxonomic. For this photograph Cunningham cut a closed blossom from the back yard. She brought it into the dining room, set up her camera, and waited three days for the bloom to open and define a compelling interior space.",

Guggenheim Foundation Fellowships in 1963 and 1964 enabled Health independently to produce the photobook A Dialogue with Solitude.

By examining childhood sadness, Heath tried to neutralize its power. This boy cries alone, ignored by his mother who turns away in the upper right corner of the frame, tall and emotionally inaccessible. Although the composition sweeps down to emphasize the boy, his small size signals his lonely anguish.",

    "annotation": "After World War I, Joost Schmidt was a member of the first class of advanced students at the Bauhaus. This progressive German academy aimed to educate a new breed of artisans, working without the traditional barriers between craftsmen, fine artists and architects. Schmidt studied with the academy\u2019s chief professors, including Johannes Itten, Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky. In 1925 Schmidt joined the senior faculty himself, directing the Plastic Arts Workshop. He also supervised the Advertising, Typography and Printing Workshop, which included the nascent photography program. This photograph of the period shows two sculptural maquettes, perhaps student work. They appear to be made from sheets of tin, folded so that they can stand freely on their own. Schmidt placed the sculptures side by side at the edge of a table, so that their shadows nearly touch, and he closely cropped the image to create a vacillating abstract geometric composition.",

But it was combatants who took most photographs of the war. This stereograph of the Battle of Passchendaele was probably taken by a foot soldier. In World War I armies dug into the earth to protect themselves from enemy fire. To gain ground they climbed to the surface and charged on foot, facing a defensive barrage and severe casualties. This stereograph of Scottish soldiers relaxing in their trenches suggests this process, and reveals the devastation of the countryside near Ypres in Belgium. Its two images were taken simultaneously with a camera with two lenses. When viewed with a device that held the photograph centered on the face, before the focal plane, they combine to create a sense of depth and dimension. This was an old-fashioned entertainment, revived by the war for its descriptive intensity.",

Morell had turned the room into a camera obscura, and students who had always taken the camera for granted suddenly understood its function. He later traveled around the world setting up cameras obscura and photographing inside them. He captured skyscrapers in New York, the Uffizi in Florence, the Eiffel Tower in Paris and many other places, projected on the walls of nearby hotel rooms. As a fellow at the Civitella Ranieri Foundation in Italy, Morell made this camera obscura photograph in a private home. Inside the modest bedroom, a dreamlike landscape of the Umbrian countryside unfurls like a dream vision, with leafy trees, meadows, and farm fields.",

The plates were prepared with a layer of microscopic grains of potato starch, dyed red, green, and blue, covered by a panchromatic silver halide emulsion. When exposed in the camera, the minuscule spots of color acted as a mosaic filter for complementary hues, creating a negative image. The plate was reverse-processed as a positive color transparency. The military photographer Jean-Baptiste Tournassoud was a friend of the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers, and one of the first to embrace the Autochrome technique. At the end of World War I he made color propaganda images of the Armistice, the Paris peace talks and negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles.",

    "annotation": "At the School of the Museum of Decorative Arts in Berlin Karl Blossfeldt studied with Professor Moritz Meurer who had him collect plant images as models for decorative design. When Blossfeldt taught at the Charlottenburg School of Arts and Crafts he built an enormous camera that could magnify specimens by 30 times. He arranged flowers, buds, and seed capsules before cardboard backgrounds, and exposed his large negatives 12 minutes. This is a closeup of one bloom of the milkweed plant, the favorite of monarch butterflies. Its flowers bloom in spherical clusters a few inches in diameter. Blossfeldt concentrated on just one as if it were a tiny sculpture. His photographs were first exhibited in 1921, and a selection later published in the photobook Urformen der Kunst (Art Forms in Nature). It became a perennial bestseller, and a sourcebook and influence on artists working in a range of media.",

He used a crisp, focused style to photograph his subjects in their own personal spaces. Newman began his career with portraits of painters, the people he emulated most. Yasuo Kuniyoshi was a widely admired figure among New York artists of the 1930s. He was born and raised in Japan, attended art school in Los Angeles, and became a teacher at the Art Students League in New York. When Newman photographed Kuniyoshi at his studio on 14th Street, amidst his folk art collection, he had been a proud American for over thirty years. Weeks later, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, drawing the United States into World War II; Kuniyoshi was condemned as an \u201cenemy alien.\u201d To avoid incarceration he was forced to declare his allegiance and to record war propaganda speeches for broadcast in Japan.",

    "annotation": "Nickolas Muray was an Olympic fencer, a pilot, and a distinguished art collector. In Hollywood, he became a sought-after celebrity portraitist during the 1920s. Muray had studied the printing arts in his native Hungary, and had the technical knowledge to pursue the color process of carbro printing. The process begins when three negatives of the same image are exposed through red, blue and green filters. The resulting gelatin silver bromide prints were chemically transformed into low-relief images of pigmented carbon on transfer paper. When precisely superimposed, these made up full color images on paper. Muray understood further how to transfer these to zinc plates for mass printing. This photograph exemplifies the high-key color preferred for printed reproduction in the 1930s-50s. Its cut-and-paste design and manipulated scale emphasize the advertised products.",

It was while recuperating at Invalidovna, the Prague military hospital, that he took up photography. In the 1920s the artist continued to photograph at Invalidovna, exploring the veterans\u2019 lives in visual metaphor. This small contact print captures a ghostly silhouette shrouded in clouds of smoke. Sudek often illuminated his subjects with reflected light, creating an obscure stillness. His personal style and imagery reflect a personal sense of isolation. Self-conscious of his amputation, Sudek isolated himself from society. He photographed the city of Prague in the same mysterious visual style. Carrying his wooden view camera and tripod through the hilly city, he captured the empty cathedral and deserted landscapes in the half-light of dawn.",

She learned about Ward 81, a locked security wing for women. Mark arranged to spend 36 days together with the residents of the secure ward, and photograph their lives. This portrait of Brenda seems unremarkable at first glance. An attractive teenager with long hair and fashionable dress, she sits cross-legged on her institutional steel bed. Illuminated by fluorescent lighting, her room is like that in any dormitory room. Brenda unashamedly displays her left arm, marked by the scars of suicide attempts and other instances of self-harm.

He organized shoots at recognizable locations in Paris and Rome, but also to farms, circuses, and the launch pads of Cape Canaveral. While his fashion and commercial work projected unusual elegance, his portraits revealed surprising aspects of character. Avedon was a great admirer of the great French film director Jean Renoir\u2019s work, and delighted in 1972 to visit him in Beverly Hills. His home was like the South of France, filled with daylight and fresh flowers. The elderly Renoir was ailing and frail, and Avedon worked sensitively to capture a likeness of visual simplicity and psychological complexity. In its full-face bust before a white background, this image typifies Avedon\u2019s portraits work at the time. He concentrated on expression with an asymmetrical visage reflecting a number of different expressions at once.",

Born and raised in Brooklyn, he was drafted into the Army in 1942, and became a squad leader in the 415th Infantry Regiment, the Timberwolves, a unit trained for night fighting. Late in 1944 the regiment was involved in the bloody Battle of the Scheldt, for which Jaffee and other regiment members were awarded the Bronze Star. Back in Brooklyn, he struggled with post traumatic stress disorder. Photography helped him concentrate, connect with people, and express his feelings. Some of Jaffee\u2019s street photographs convey despondency and dread. Other images demonstrate his acute perception, his skill at capturing a powerful moment, and his gift for storytelling. Jaffee was particularly sensitive to the expressive quality of posture. Even when photographing people from the back he could capture a relationship of affection and trust.",

    "annotation": "The tabloid photojournalist Arthur Fellig created sensational images of dramatic events in New York City under the pseudonym Weegee. He built a freelance career on sensational images that he could sell to tabloid newspapers and true-crime magazines. His methods prefigured the celebrity paparazzi of the 1950s, and his style contributed to the cinematic style of film noir. Weegee monitored the teletype\u2014and later the police radio\u2014and usually arrived first for urgent events around the city. He used a flash to shoot high-contrast images calculated for the heavy newspaper inking of tabloid presses. To get his photographs to the newspapers first, Weegee often developed his negatives in a makeshift darkroom in the trunk of his 1928 Ford sedan. He had a knack for ironic images, and those with a cruel twist. Typical of Weegee\u2019s work of the late 1930s, Tire Inspection is the image of a homeless panhandler, rubbing his feet as he settles for the night on a Hell\u2019s Kitchen pavement.",

Uelsmann experimented with different ways of combining their details in fantastic images influenced by Surrealism. He collected his own repertoire of original negatives, including thousands of images of landscapes, architecture, figures and foliage. In 1967 he outfitted a darkroom with seven enlargers that enabled him to align his negatives into one composite print. In this broad panoramic landscape the laws of physics seem no longer to apply. A leafy tree with its roots unfurled hovers above an island in a mountain lake. The island itself is airborne, and its underside is reflected in the glassy water. Close examination shows how Uelsmann created the background and floating island is a mirror image.",

This unusual view from inside the mezzanine level of the Eiffel Tower exemplifies the originality of Kert\u00e9sz\u2019s vision. The portability of the miniature camera, and its fast exposure, enabled him to crouch, reach and lean, stretching his body to position the camera at odd angles for a fresh viewpoint. Kert\u00e9sz often shot multiple views of a single subject, and his sequencing of images were unprecedented in photojournalism. In the mid-1930s he associated with the Surrealists, and his photographs appeared in the magazines Bifur, Vari\u00e9t\u00e9s and Minotaure.",

Working alone, she explored hidden corners of society to photograph subjects like transvestites, carnival performers, nudists and strippers. Aside from their place in society, Arbus was interested in their personalities and intimate relationships. She befriended her subjects and sometimes their exchange became as important to her as her photographs. Arbus often attempted to represent the association of couples and multiple siblings.

    "annotation": "After World War II, the victorious Allies divided Germany into four occupation zones. The capital city was dissected: West Berlin became a capitalist nation with a parliamentary government, while East Berlin was united to the USSR as a Communist country. Millions fled from the East threatening its economic stability. Thus, on August 31, 1961, East German and Soviet soldiers erected a guarded concrete barrier dividing Berlin. Weeks later, Dan Budnik arrived, on assignment from Magnum Photo Agency. He photographed the wire fences, concrete barriers, and guard posts. His moving photographs represent groups of Berliners gathering near the wall to wave at the loved ones they could only glimpse at a distance. This boy in West Berlin encapsulates the dilemma. He perches on a rickety tower of bricks to gaze through a hole in the wall. Budnik printed in grainy tones, like the concrete, shadowy factories and gray skies that portend a grim future.",

    "annotation": "Edward Weston was a pivotal figure in the transformation of American creative photography from the poetry of Pictorialism to the sharp detail of straight photography. Although he created soft-focus images in the 1910s, in 1923-26 when he worked in Mexico, the tropical sunshine and arid atmosphere led him to a style of sharp focus and precision. Weston exploited the limits of photographic technology, simultaneously to convey sculptural form and surface texture. This is apparent in this image of model Charis Wilson. Carefully framing the figure, Weston accentuated its sinuous outlines and plastic form. Most remarkable in its time, however, was the way that this photograph depicted texture, from the smooth contours of flesh to the granularity of sand.",

    "annotation": "When a colleague introduced the miniature camera and enlarger to Alfred Eisenstadt shortly after World War I, he immediately appreciated their possibilities. He became a freelance photojournalist, and earned a reputation for carrying just one small camera, and for his courteous bearing. Eisenstaedt\u2019s restraint and his ability to blend with his subjects is apparent in this famous photograph taken at the eighteenth-century La Scala opera house in Milan. He pictured its scale and opulence in a view that ranged from the main floor seats to the shaded loggione under the ceiling. The formal dress, the lights, and excited anticipation of an opening night are all captured in this image. In April 1936, Henry R. Luce invited Eisenstaedt to join the staff of the newly founded illustrated weekly LIFE magazine. Over the course of his career, the photographer covered over 2,500 assignments for the journal, and photographed 92 covers.",
