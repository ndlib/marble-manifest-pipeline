    "description": "My portfolio is meant to showcase the movement of artistic styles in Europe during the Renaissance Period. The Renaissance entailed a \"rebirth\" of knowledge and appreciation for classic Greek and Rome that had wide-spread impacts on European society, especially on art and architecture. Art styles during this time became more naturalistic, reflecting both  the development of better artistic techniques and a renewed emphasis on humanism and the importance of temporal subjects. Though the Renaissance began in Italy, it spread throughout Europe, and took on a slightly different character in what came to be known as the \"Northern Renaissance.\" My portfolio includes examples from both northern and southern Europe. The Renaissance revitalized Europe and made possible much of the modern world we know today. I hope my portfolio helps demonstrate some of the broad artistic changes that the Renaissance fostered among European artists. ",

The representation of Jesus's body is much more naturalistic, representing a greater focus on his human body than on his divinity. The colors used are much more sober, showing the movement away from icon-style imagery in Western religious art.",

As such, it represents much of the pre-Renaissance style, as can be noted with the representations of the Madonna and Child, which have a very two-dimensional and not particularly naturalistic style. The icon-like style of the portrait, also typical of Late Middle Ages Western European art, can be seen through the heavy use of gold, the medium of wood, and the arch-like shape of the piece.",

In the mid-1920s, she wanted to expand beyond her rarified clientele and took her camera to the country in upstate New York. Later she befriended the Pulitzer-Prize winning writer Julia Mood Peterkin. When visiting Peterkin at her plantation, Lang Syne, in South Carolina, Ulmann had the chance to photograph the farm workers, who lived much as their enslaved forebears. Yet Ulmann\u2019s images also represent sociability, generosity, and repose. This is one of several of Ulmann\u2019s Lang Syne images that present her subject\u2019s occupation as integral to her personality. A woman of dignity and accomplishment, she shares community responsibilities. Ulmann published her photographs, along with a selection of Peterkin\u2019s writing about African American life, in Roll, Jordan, Roll, named for the eighteenth-century Anglican hymn embraced by the African American community.",

Working from his image, he drew on a sheet of writing paper with a mixture of watery ink, gum arabic, and light-sensitive potassium dichromate.

When the sheet was washed, an image of tinted gum was left where the artist had drawn.",

In the late 1890s, he made watercolors and oil paintings in a luminous style inspired by Impressionism and the work of James McNeill Whistler. He experimented with visual effects of different colors in several versions of the moon rising through a screen of trees. This photograph is one of them, made on Long Island in summer 1904. To explore color effects in his photographs, Steichen printed this image in platinum, then superimposed layers of colored gum from the same negative on the same sheet. He achieved a similar effect in this enlarged photogravure, made sixty years later, by directing the intaglio printer to ink and wipe the plate with black, blue, and green inks. One of Steichen\u2019s few surviving Moonrise paintings of the 1910s is now in the Snite Museum collection and on view on the second floor.",

He was a professor at VkhUTEMAS (the Higher State Artistic and Technical Studios), an academy conceived to produce well-designed, utilitarian objects for everyday living. Rodchenko embraced photography as a universally accessible visual medium. VkhUTEMAS took over Yushkov House from the Moscow Art Academy, a venerable beaux-arts-style city palace where art had been taught for over a century. When Rodchenko photographed the academy, however, he concentrated on this adjacent dormitory, built on the academy ground after the Revolution. In this Modernist high-rise block, students, faculty and administrators occupied identical apartments. The artist used the building\u2019s geometry as an arresting graphic design element.",

In 1967 the photographer was permitted to take his camera into the prisons of Texas, where he made many friends among the inmates over the fourteen-month project.

In the 1940s Morris combined his photographs with excerpts of original prose \u201cphototexts,\u201d interdependent works of art for exhibition. Some of these projects were published as books, including The Home Place, of 1948.

Every day he went out onto the streets of Manhattan and shot candid 35-mm Kodachrome slides of his fellow New Yorkers. In the darkroom he methodically studied the limitations of chromogenic printing. Meyerowitz bought an old 8 x 10-inch view camera in 1976. It demanded a slower rhythm, and its expensive film caused the photographer to focus on static images without figures. In Vivian\u2019s Things, Meyerowitz used his large camera to investigate light, space and color. Bright seaside light pours into the bedroom of a rented Cape Cod beach house. The reflections from different angles in glass surfaces around the room provide a complex view of the small space. Meyerowitz arranged a riot of colors and patterns reminiscent of the work of Les Nabis, the young Parisian painters of the 1890s\u2014like Pierre Bonnard and \u00c9douard Vuillard\u2014who combined the bright colors of Impressionism with compositional distortion.",

He settled in Los Angeles to study photography, then moved to New York to work as a creative photographer. Sugimoto\u2019s photographs of displays at the American Museum of Natural History, with their taxidermy mounts in fictive natural habitats, confronted themes of creativity, perception, and time. This image from Sugimoto\u2019s Theaters series grapples with similar issues. To photograph the lavish decor of 1920s American movie palaces, he set up his view camera under the projection booth in each deserted auditorium. He set the timer for the length of a feature film, and ran the movie. The individual frames of the film canceled each other to create a searing white light on screen, illuminating the empty interior. In this way, Sugimoto photographed the opulent room, the duration of the film, and the passage of time.",

In 1930, however, he was stricken with tuberculosis and moved to the American Southwest, where he met and married the painter Gina Schnaufer. They settled in Tesuque, north of Santa Fe, and began a family. Knee explored the countryside, photographing the Spanish colonial churches of the region. This chapel at La Manga is a private shrine. It was built in 1932 by David Ortega and his neighbors in gratitude for his brother\u2019s recovery from an illness.

The scheme was promoted by alderman Sidney Story and the district came to be known as Storyville. Twenty-five-year old Ernest J. Belloc had then been a New Orleans photographer for several years. He was comfortable in Storyville, blocks from where he had grown up, and he photographed in its gaming rooms, opium dens and bordellos. This is one of a series of intimate portraits of women, thought to be Storyville prostitutes. The familiarity of these images has prompted speculation that Bellocq was a brothel habitu\u00e9 and that photographs reveal friendships with the women. This is a recent print from a group of negatives, discovered in 1967, that prompted much creative fantasy about the photographer and his life.",

Frank photographed consumers who seem obsessed with these products, but unaware of each other.

To illuminate supersonic exposures, he engineered lightbulbs filled with argon, and then xenon, that could produce 60 flashes of light per second. In order to demonstrate his stroboscopic lighting systems and envision their broad scientific applications, Edgerton made experimental photographs in the laboratory, often of sports subjects. He recruited Fesler, the Big Ten MVP of 1930 to kick a football in the studio. This split-second exposure reveals the unexpected physics of the event.

Schmidt studied with the academy\u2019s chief professors, including Johannes Itten, Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky. In 1925 Schmidt joined the senior faculty himself, directing the Plastic Arts Workshop. He also supervised the Advertising, Typography and Printing Workshop, which included the nascent photography program. This photograph of the period shows two sculptural maquettes, perhaps student work. They appear to be made from sheets of tin, folded so that they can stand freely on their own. Schmidt placed the sculptures side by side at the edge of a table, so that their shadows nearly touch, and he closely cropped the image to create a vacillating abstract geometric composition.",

But it was combatants who took most photographs of the war. This stereograph of the Battle of Passchendaele was probably taken by a foot soldier. In World War I armies dug into the earth to protect themselves from enemy fire. To gain ground they climbed to the surface and charged on foot, facing a defensive barrage and severe casualties. This stereograph of Scottish soldiers relaxing in their trenches suggests this process, and reveals the devastation of the countryside near Ypres in Belgium. Its two images were taken simultaneously with a camera with two lenses. When viewed with a device that held the photograph centered on the face, before the focal plane, they combine to create a sense of depth and dimension. This was an old-fashioned entertainment, revived by the war for its descriptive intensity.",

The plates were prepared with a layer of microscopic grains of potato starch, dyed red, green, and blue, covered by a panchromatic silver halide emulsion. When exposed in the camera, the minuscule spots of color acted as a mosaic filter for complementary hues, creating a negative image. The plate was reverse-processed as a positive color transparency. The military photographer Jean-Baptiste Tournassoud was a friend of the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers, and one of the first to embrace the Autochrome technique. At the end of World War I he made color propaganda images of the Armistice, the Paris peace talks and negotiation of the Treaty of Versailles.",

The process begins when three negatives of the same image are exposed through red, blue and green filters. The resulting gelatin silver bromide prints were chemically transformed into low-relief images of pigmented carbon on transfer paper. When precisely superimposed, these made up full color images on paper. Muray understood further how to transfer these to zinc plates for mass printing. This photograph exemplifies the high-key color preferred for printed reproduction in the 1930s-50s. Its cut-and-paste design and manipulated scale emphasize the advertised products.",

She was a set photographer on location for Milo\u0161 Forman\u2019s film One Flew over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest, filmed in 1975 at the Oregon State Hospital. She learned about Ward 81, a locked security wing for women. Mark arranged to spend 36 days together with the residents of the secure ward, and photograph their lives. This portrait of Brenda seems unremarkable at first glance. An attractive teenager with long hair and fashionable dress, she sits cross-legged on her institutional steel bed. Illuminated by fluorescent lighting, her room is like that in any dormitory room. Brenda unashamedly displays her left arm, marked by the scars of suicide attempts and other instances of self-harm. Mark\u2019s compassionate approach, before and beyond clicking the shutter, enabled this young woman to share her vulnerability and something of her pain.",

He organized shoots at recognizable locations in Paris and Rome, but also to farms, circuses, and the launch pads of Cape Canaveral. While his fashion and commercial work projected unusual elegance, his portraits revealed surprising aspects of character. Avedon was a great admirer of the great French film director Jean Renoir\u2019s work, and delighted in 1972 to visit him in Beverly Hills. His home was like the South of France, filled with daylight and fresh flowers. The elderly Renoir was ailing and frail, and Avedon worked sensitively to capture a likeness of visual simplicity and psychological complexity. In its full-face bust before a white background, this image typifies Avedon\u2019s portraits work at the time. He concentrated on expression with an asymmetrical visage reflecting a number of different expressions at once.",

Late in 1944 the regiment was involved in the bloody Battle of the Scheldt, for which Jaffee and other regiment members were awarded the Bronze Star. Back in Brooklyn, he struggled with post traumatic stress disorder. Photography helped him concentrate, connect with people, and express his feelings. Some of Jaffee\u2019s street photographs convey despondency and dread. Other images demonstrate his acute perception, his skill at capturing a powerful moment, and his gift for storytelling. Jaffee was particularly sensitive to the expressive quality of posture. Even when photographing people from the back he could capture a relationship of affection and trust.",

His methods prefigured the celebrity paparazzi of the 1950s, and his style contributed to the cinematic style of film noir. Weegee monitored the teletype\u2014and later the police radio\u2014and usually arrived first for urgent events around the city. He used a flash to shoot high-contrast images calculated for the heavy newspaper inking of tabloid presses. To get his photographs to the newspapers first, Weegee often developed his negatives in a makeshift darkroom in the trunk of his 1928 Ford sedan. He had a knack for ironic images, and those with a cruel twist. Typical of Weegee\u2019s work of the late 1930s, Tire Inspection is the image of a homeless panhandler, rubbing his feet as he settles for the night on a Hell\u2019s Kitchen pavement.",

Uelsmann experimented with different ways of combining their details in fantastic images influenced by Surrealism. He collected his own repertoire of original negatives, including thousands of images of landscapes, architecture, figures and foliage. In 1967 he outfitted a darkroom with seven enlargers that enabled him to align his negatives into one composite print. In this broad panoramic landscape the laws of physics seem no longer to apply. A leafy tree with its roots unfurled hovers above an island in a mountain lake. The island itself is airborne, and its underside is reflected in the glassy water.

    "annotation": "After World War II, the victorious Allies divided Germany into four occupation zones. The capital city was dissected: West Berlin became a capitalist nation with a parliamentary government, while East Berlin was united to the USSR as a Communist country. Millions fled from the East threatening its economic stability. Thus, on August 31, 1961, East German and Soviet soldiers erected a guarded concrete barrier dividing Berlin. Weeks later, Dan Budnik arrived, on assignment from Magnum Photo Agency. He photographed the wire fences, concrete barriers, and guard posts. His moving photographs represent groups of Berliners gathering near the wall to wave at the loved ones they could only glimpse at a distance. This boy in West Berlin encapsulates the dilemma. He perches on a rickety tower of bricks to gaze through a hole in the wall. Budnik printed in grainy tones, like the concrete, shadowy factories and gray skies that portend a grim future.",

    "annotation": "Edward Weston was a pivotal figure in the transformation of American creative photography from the poetry of Pictorialism to the sharp detail of straight photography. Although he created soft-focus images in the 1910s, in 1923-26 when he worked in Mexico, the tropical sunshine and arid atmosphere led him to a style of sharp focus and precision. Weston exploited the limits of photographic technology, simultaneously to convey sculptural form and surface texture. This is apparent in this image of model Charis Wilson. Carefully framing the figure, Weston accentuated its sinuous outlines and plastic form. Most remarkable in its time, however, was the way that this photograph depicted texture, from the smooth contours of flesh to the granularity of sand.",

    "annotation": "When a colleague introduced the miniature camera and enlarger to Alfred Eisenstadt shortly after World War I, he immediately appreciated their possibilities. He became a freelance photojournalist, and earned a reputation for carrying just one small camera, and for his courteous bearing. Eisenstaedt\u2019s restraint and his ability to blend with his subjects is apparent in this famous photograph taken at the eighteenth-century La Scala opera house in Milan. He pictured its scale and opulence in a view that ranged from the main floor seats to the shaded loggione under the ceiling. The formal dress, the lights, and excited anticipation of an opening night are all captured in this image. In April 1936, Henry R. Luce invited Eisenstaedt to join the staff of the newly founded illustrated weekly LIFE magazine. Over the course of his career, the photographer covered over 2,500 assignments for the journal, and photographed 92 covers.",
