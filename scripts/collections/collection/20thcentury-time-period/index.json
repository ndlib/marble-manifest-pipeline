There are additional letters written by Arthur (5), Ethel's colleague Pierre Pulinekse (4), Ethel herself to her Aunt Anna Le Rossignol (4), and others. The bulk of correspondence took place in 1918. The letters cover topics of cultural interest, such as British-German animosity and perceptions of the war. Most of Arthur's letters are vague and do not reveal his location or the details of military operations. His correspondence covers the period 1914-1919. All together, there are 52 letters, 42 envelopes, 14 post cards, a photograph album, a telegram, a copy of strategic battle plans, a pamphlet, and other miscellaneous items."}, "rights": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/"}, {"id": "https://presentation-iiif.library.nd.edu/1986.059.001/manifest", "type": "Manifest", "label": {"en": ["Platter with Kachina Face"]}, "metadata": [{"label": {"en": ["Creator"]}, "value": {"en": ["Maria Martinez, Julian Martinez"]}}, {"label": {"en": ["Date"]}, "value": {"en": ["c. 1935"]}}, {"label": {"en": ["Material Extent"]}, "value": {"en": ["14 1/2 in.
